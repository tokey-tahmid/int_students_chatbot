Regulations require that coursework be part of a course of study. Elective and additional credits are permitted, but placeholder classes are not. The following courses do NOT count as enrollment:




Use of Facilities Courses;

Exceptions to Full-Time Enrollment




The summer semester is an approved break if you have enrolled at UT full-time in the spring and plan to enroll full-time in the fall.


In your final semester, you are only required to enroll in the credit hours needed to complete your program. 
Remember, 
there must be at least one-credit in-person in your final semester. You are required to complete a form to verify your final semester. We have a guide for this at

Graduate students in the research phase of their program are allowed to only take thesis or dissertation hours.
