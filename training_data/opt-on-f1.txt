OPT is program that allows F-1 students to gain experience working in their field after graduation. OPT is authorized for 1-3 years depending on your field of study. OPT is completed at the end of your program. It is important to begin planning for OPT before your graduation date.


Applying for OPT


OPT applications involve International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS), your academic or faculty advisor, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Appling for OPT has multiple steps, and we recommend that you begin your application 90 days before your graduation date.
