The spouse and children (under age 21) of an F-1 student may hold dependent status and accompany the student in the United States during the student’s academic program.


Each dependent receives a separate I-20/DS-2019, and must apply in person for an F-2 visa to come to the US. Dependents are eligible to stay in the United States in F-2 dependent status as long as the student maintains legal F-1 status.


I-20 Application Process for F-2 Dependents


In order to add your dependent(s) to your I-20, log in to the 
iVols portal
 with your Net ID and password. Then follow these instructions:






From the F-1 Student Services section of the iVols portal, select the Add Dependents option.








2. Fill out the Add Dependent E-form.


 




3. Fill out the Financial Documentation E-form and, if necessary, the optional GA Verification form.


Be advised that you must provide financial documentation showing enough funds for a full year of study, plus
 an additional $7,080 USD for a spouse or each child.


Once you submit the required forms in iVols, ISSS will process your request. If your documentation is sufficient, ISSS will issue an updated I-20 that includes your dependents as well as I-20s for each dependent.


DS-2019 Application Process for J-2 Dependents


The spouse and children (under age 21) of a J-1 student may hold dependent status and accompany the student in the United States during the student’s academic program.


Each dependent receives a separate I-20/DS-2019, and must apply in person for an J-2 visa to come to the US. Dependents are eligible to stay in the United States in J-2 dependent status as long as the student maintains legal J-1 status.


J-1 students should contact their 
international student advisor
 for instructions on adding a J-2 dependent.
