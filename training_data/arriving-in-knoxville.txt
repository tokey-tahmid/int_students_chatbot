Your first few weeks at the University of Tennessee (UT) will be busy, but we have some helpful guides that will get you settled in!


Immigration Check In


Once you arrive in Knoxville, we can complete an immigration check in. This official registers you with the Department of Homeland of Security (DHS). Your status is 
NOT 
valid until this is done, and you will not be able to get a driver’s license or complete Human Resources paperwork until this is done.


Important, 
the immigration check in is 
MANDATORY. 
You do 
NOT 
have valid status until this is done.


You can complete the immigration check in by following the instructions at 
Completing the Initial Immigration Check In
.


Transportation


Transportation in Knoxville can be very different form what you are accustomed to, and there are some adjustments that have to be be made. Some important points to remember are:




Most students will not be able to live within walking distance of the campus.


Most people travel by car in Knoxville.


Public transportation is present in Knoxville, but it takes some extra planning to use.




We have created a guide for you on 
Using Transportation in Knoxville
 that has helpful details on this process.
