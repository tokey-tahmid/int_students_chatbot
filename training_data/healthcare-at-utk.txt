The 
Student Health Center
 serves as the primary care provider for the University of Tennessee student community and provides outpatient medical care for all currently enrolled students who have paid their health fee. The health fee will be automatically assessed to undergraduate students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours and graduate students enrolled in 9 or more credit hours. CGE recommends that all other international students request that the health fee be added to their billing statement, because health care through the Student Health Center is by far the most affordable option for students. For a comprehensive list of the health care services available at the UT Student Health Center, see

The University of Tennessee also offers mental health and wellness services through the 
Counseling Center
. Many students benefit from the support provided by individual or group therapy. Students experiencing depression, homesickness, anxiety, or related issues may experience a decline in academic performance. It is best to address these problems as soon as possible. CGE encourages students to seek help from the Counseling Center. CGE advisors are able to assist students in contacting the Counseling Center when needed.
