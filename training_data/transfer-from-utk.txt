Immigration regulations allow an F-1 student to transfer to another university. The student must first obtain written confirmation of acceptance to another college or university. Next, the student should follow the University of Tennesseeâ€™s transfer out procedures. Finally, a CGE advisor will transfer your SEVIS record to the new university.


Transfer Out Process


Access the 
Transfer Out request form
 in 
iVols portal
. You will be required to upload a copy of your official admission letter from your new school. You should be able to provide the SEVIS school code of your new university. If the new school has a transfer-in form, please submit this to CGE when you submit the Transfer Out request.


Note: Students who graduate or complete OPT must have their SEVIS record released from the CGE to the new institution before the end of their grace period.* Immigration regulations require that students begin their new program at the new school within five months from their last program end date/last day of semester classes, or within five months from their last date of employment (if on OPT).


*The grace period for F-1 students is 60 days after graduation or OPT period.


Note: Students on OPT must have their SEVIS record released before going beyond 90 days of unemployment.


J-1 students should contact their international student advisor for instructions on transferring out of UT.
